WIPO-SCRAPER
============

This scraper fetches the the meeting logs from the WIPO transcription site and
stores it into local text files.  Still needs testing and edges refined.
You'll need to stop the script and restart after every session, at least for
now.  Bug reports welcome.

Installation
------------
I recommend installing this inside a virtualenv and installing the dependencies with pip.

* Create a virtualenv: `virtualenv env`

* Activate it: `source env/bin/activate`

* Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Now run the script with
`./script`
